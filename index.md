I am a fifth year Mathematics PhD student at North Carolina State University. In broad terms, I am interested in applied algebraic geometry. More specifically, I use techniques from algebraic geometry and combinatorics to tackle problems in more applied areas (e.g. statistical models, dynamical systems).
