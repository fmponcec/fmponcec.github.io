I am interested in the use of algebraic and combinatorial tools to answer questions in other fields of mathematics (usually more applied ones). The main areas of applications I have worked on are: marginal independence models (mathematical statistics), continuous Newton's method (dynamical systems/homotopy continuation), and linear compartmental models (dynamical systems/mathematical biology). In broad terms, we prove structural properties of the objects in these applications (statistical models/dynamical systems) that rely on a combinatorial or algebraic object (e.g. posets/toric ideals/relative root configurations).

I am also interested in numerical algebraic geometry. In particular, I am working on a homotopy continuation-based method to find real roots of zero dimensional systems without having to compute non-real solutions.
